They will also be able to sign out when they are finished playing. They have the ability to change their password at any time while they are signed in. Additionally, they have the opportunity to start a new game when their game is over. They will be notified when the game is over and of the winner, or if there is a tie, and will be prompted to start a new game. The user will also be able to see how many games they have played on their account.
